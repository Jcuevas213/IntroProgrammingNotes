# Chapter 1 - Create a Calculator

print("Hello")  # strings go inside quotes

# Printing results of expressions
print("3 + 2")
print(3 + 2)  # no quotes

# Printing multiple items
print("3 + 2 =", 3 + 2)  # separated by commas
print("Francis", "Parker")  # adds a space in between each item

# Escape codes
# backslash "escapes" the next character.  Python treats that character as text
print("I need to print a double quote \", how do you do it?")

# tab escape code, just like hitting the tab key
print("First\tMiddle\tLast")
print("Francis\tWayland\tParker")

# return escape code, just like hitting the enter/return key
print("line1\nline2\nline3")
print("Programming\n\tis\n\t\tfun")

print("file at c:\\this folder\\new folder")

# Comments
# this is a single line comment

'''
This is a multi
line comment
Very useful for troubleshooting
print("code inside any comment will not run")
'''

# Assignment Operator
# the equal sign

# Only one way to create a variable
x = 5  # the variable named x is given a value of 5
print("x")
print(x)
print("x =", x)

print(x + 1)
print(x + x)
print(x)

x = 10  # this changes the value of x
print(x)

x + 1
print(x)

x = x + 1  # you can do this in coding, not in math class
# x + 5 = 3 # this is legal in math, but not in code
print(x)

# Python uses snake_case for variable naming
# Other languages might use camelCase or PascalCase or kebab-case
