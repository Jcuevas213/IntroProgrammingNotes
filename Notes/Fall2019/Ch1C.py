#  Assignment Operator (equal sign)
# the only way to assign a value to a variable name
x = 5  # variable name is x.  Assigned a value of 5.
print(x)
print(x + 10)
print(x)
x + 10  # has no effect
print(x)

x = x + 10  # you can use the variable itself when assigning value
print(x)

x += 10  # does the same thing
print(x)


# Variables
x = 5
X = 6
print(x)  # python is case sensitive

# python uses snake_case, not camelCase, PascalCase, or kebab-case.
first_name = "Francis"  # correct snake_case
# first name = "Francis"  # illegal (no spaces allowed)
# first.name = "Francis"  # illegal (no dots)

eight_ball = 8  # correct
# 8ball = 8  # illegal cannot start with a number
ball8 = 8  # this could also be correct
