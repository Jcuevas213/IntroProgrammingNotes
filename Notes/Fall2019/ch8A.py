Chapter 8 - Animation
Aaron Lee - 2019
X linear motion with wrapping (i.e. cars going down road, clouds going by)
X linear motion with bouncing (i.e. tennis match, eyes looking left right)
growing or shrinking (i.e. window rolling down on car)
color shift (i.e. sky color shift)
blinking (i.e. twinkling stars, flickering candle)
color change (flashing lights on fire truck, lights on Christmas tree)
acceleration (i.e. gravity fall, bouncing, changing speeds)
rotation (requires trig - ferris wheel, clock etc.)
X animation with lists (i.e. snowfall, leaves falling)
