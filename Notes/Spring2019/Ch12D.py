# Chapter 12 - Classes

# New vocabulary specific to classes
# class - grouping of related information into a representation of an object
# object - a thing in a program that can be manipulated and represents a class
# instance - a specific object in your program

# attributes - variables that belong to a class or instance
# methods - a function that belongs to a class or instance
# constructor method - special method (__init__) that runs automatically when the object is created

# dot notation - how we interact with an instance outside of the class structure
# self - how we interact with an object inside the class

# parent
# child
# inheritance
