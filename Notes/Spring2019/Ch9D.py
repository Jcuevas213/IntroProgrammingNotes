# Functions are our friends
# - makes our code easy to read
# - make our code reusable

# SCOPE
# Python has relatively simple scoping rules
# Built in > global > local
# built in variables are Python wide
# global variables are far left (no indent)
# local variables live inside functions

def f():
    a = 1

#print(a)  # local variables are not alive in the global space
