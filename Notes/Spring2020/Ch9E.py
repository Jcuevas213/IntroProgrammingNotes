# SCOPE
# often misunderstood by new programmers
# Variable scope is where the variable is ALIVE and where it can be ACCESSED
# If you want to know where a varialbe is alive, look at where it was born

# global variables can be SEEN anywhere
# local variables can be SEEN only inside the function

def f():
    x = 10  # this variable is LOCAL

f()
# print(x)  # local variables cannot be SEEN in the global scope




y = 5  # this is GLOBAL

def f2():
    print(y)  # global can be SEEN locally

f2()




z = 11

def f3():
    # z += 1  # cannot change a global variable in the local scope (can only SEE it)
    print(z)

f3()


# "Rules for scope"
# We can see GLOBAL variables in the LOCAL scope but cannot change them
# We cannot see or change LOCAL variables in the GLOBAL scope


# RETURN AND CAPTURE (how we get around some scope issues)
def double_me(x):
    return x * 2  # return

x = 5
x = double_me(x)  # capture in global scope
print(x)
